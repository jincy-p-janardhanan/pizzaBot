# pizzaBot
This is a simple chatbot which can be used to order pizzas. As of now, it has only conversational capabilities. More updates will be added soon to make it fully functional.

It is built on [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com) with [**DialogFlow**](https://dialogflow.com).

I am doing this project as part of the [**"Building Conversational Experiences with Dialogflow"**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conversational-experiences-dialogflow) course on [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org).
