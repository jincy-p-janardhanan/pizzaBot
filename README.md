# pizzaBot
This is a simple chatbot which can be used to order pizzas. 

It is built on [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com) with [**DialogFlow**](https://dialogflow.com).

I did this project as part of the [**"Building Conversational Experiences with Dialogflow"**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conversational-experiences-dialogflow) course on [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org).
